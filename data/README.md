# Human Designed Shapes

We have manually designed more than 600 shapes with different attributes for Bongard problem synthesis. The action program information and the attributes for the shapes are saved in `human_designed_shapes.tsv` and `human_designed_shapes_attributes.tsv`, respectively.

Note that in the `human_designed_shapes_attributes.tsv`, `1` means certain shape has certain attribute, `0` means certain shape does not have certain attribute, `-1` means certain attribute might not be applicable for certain shape.
